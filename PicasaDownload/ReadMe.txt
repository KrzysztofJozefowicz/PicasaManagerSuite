PicasaDownload is a set of console scipts which allows to download content from Picasa webservice.
Apart from downloading photos, it can also be used to save limited types of metadata like photo summary,comments,gps coordinates stored to EXIF or separate text file. 
Album information and setting can be also stored.


Limitations:
- video download not yet supported (cannot be done via Python GoogleAPI)
- album photocover can only be saved as cropped photo

Scripts:
PicasaDownloader.py - script to download Picasa content
GetAlbumsUrl.py - script to get links of albums from selected Picasa account

Hints:
- check -h for possible input parameters
- to reuse configuration parameters use config.txt
- input parameters overwrites those from config.txt
- download content will be stored in place pointed at "WorkingDirectory", directory named as album
- multiple albums download can be achived by using list of urls generated by GetAlbumsUrl.py
- in case of using non OS compatible charactes in Picasa (eg. national special letter in filenames and albums,comments and photo and album summary) ConvertToAscii can set to standardise character set. Still it is possible to hold orginal character set for further usage (eg. Picasa upload).
